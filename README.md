**COMSE6156 - Topics on Software Engineering**

This repository represents a fraction of the final project for COMSE6156.

**/apache-cassandra-2.2.6**
The directory /apache-cassandra-2.2.6 has the files each node that composes the cluster should have.
The key file is conf/cassandra.yaml, which contains the listening IP (the own node address) and the seeds (the main node)

**/scripts**
The directory /scripts contain the testing queries performed during evaluation testing

**/diagrams**
The directory /diagrams contain visual data on cluster architecture and server architecture, as described on final report.

**data modelling**
The files exceed any public repository service limit, so here are their external links.
The file genome.tsv is the raw genome file. 


The file gen.csv is the result of mining on genome.tsv. This is the file imported to Cassandra. https://www.dropbox.com/s/0ts12bfsr4osl0u/gen.csv?dl=0
